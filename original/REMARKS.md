# REMARKS.

There are many matters which it would be interesting and useful, and even indispensable, to set forth in the introduction to a complete Dictionary of this language, but from causes already referred to, most of them cannot even be touched upon here. A few notes, however, are imperatively necessary.

## VOWELS.

a pronounced like *a* in *far*
e pronounced like *e* in *bed*
i pronounced like *ee* in *seen*.
o pronounced like *aw* in *saw*, but a little more open.
u pronounced like *u* in *put*, *rude*.
ṳ nearly as *u* in lowland Scotch *abune*; or *eu* in French *heure*.

## DIPHTHONGS.

ai, au, oa, oai, oi, ou, ua, ui. In all these each vowel is pronounced with its own proper sound.

## CONSONANTS.

The consonants are nearly all as in English.

ch is pronounced as in *church*.<br>
g is always hard as in *go*; never as in *gin*.<br>
h is always sounded except when final.<br>
j is pronounced as in *jet*.<br>
ng, as in *sing*, *ring*,<br>
s, always as in *so*, *sing*; never as in *lose*.<br>
z, always as *ds* or *dz*; never as in *zeal*, *zone*.<br>
k and t as finals are so much alike as to be scarcely distinguishable.<br>
m and ng will be found written any vowel (e.g. n̂g, m̃); often also preceded by a consonant (e.g. hm̄, sńg, kng, kñg). “The nature of these syllables without a distinct vowel becomes at once unmistakable in singing, as at such a word all vocal sound at once ceases, and nothing is heard but a dull nasal murmur.

“The ASPIRATED CONSONANTS are a very remakrable feature in all the languages of China, and require very special attention. They are kh, th, ph, and chh. The sounds are the same as those indicated by the same notation in the languages of India, being formed by a real distinct aspiration pronounced after the respective consonants......The sounds are almost the same as those often used by Irishmen when pronouncing with a strong borgue such words as *come*, *pig*, *&c*; they are also often heard in the mouths of the Scottish Highlanders.

“kh may be thus described :— Pronounce....*look here!* repidly and clearly, cut off *loo-* and *-re*, and you have the Chinese ‘khi’.” * The other aspirated consonants might be illustrated in a similar manner.
[ch is *not* an aspirated consonant — see above.]

* From Dr. Carstaire Douglas's admirable Dictionary of the Amoy Vernacular, an invaluable work to the student of the closely allied vernacular of Swatow.

## TONES.

Any attempt to write the colloquial language of Swatow without indicating the tones carries its condemnation on the face of it. It is utterly impossible to speak intelligibly while disregarding this essential feature.

There are four great classes of tones—1st, Phêⁿ(or, Pêⁿ); 2d, Siãng; 3d, Khṳ̀; 4th, Ji̍p. In the Swatow Colloquial eight separate tones are distinguished from one another:—

1. chiēⁿ-phêⁿ		as	saⁿ, *a coat*.
2. ẽ-phêⁿ		as	nâng, *a man*.
3. siãng-siaⁿ		as	hái, *the sea*.
4. chiēⁿ-khṳ̀		as	sì, *the world*.
5. ẽ-khṳ̀		as	lĩ, *profit*.
6. khṳ̀-siaⁿ		as	bō, *a cap*.
7. chiēⁿ-ji̍p		as	pat, *to know*.
8. ẽ-ji̍p		as	pa̍t, *another*.
 
In combinations of two or more syllables, very important modifications occur in the tones. A learner is apt to think that, the tone of a word having been once fixed, he will find it the same in all circumstances, and to be surprised when he hears familiar words pronounced in quite another tone. It would be difficult, and is quite unnecessary, to describe here the characters of the various tones and the changes which they undergo in combination, as they can be most easily and correctly learnt by listening to the speech of a native.

## NASALS.

A small ⁿ written above the line at the end of a syllable indicates that the whole syllable becomes nasal. In words beginning with m, n, and ng this symbol has been in some cases omitted where it ought to have been written.

## HYPHENS.

The general idea involved in the use of hyphens is to link together those syllables which are so closely connected that the tones of certain of them are affected by the connexion. This principle, however, is not carried out to the full extent, because in many cases the words thus influencing one another would be too numerous to link together in this manner.

A DOUBLE HYPHEN implies that the word preceding it retains its own proper tone in full force, and that the word or words following it are either enclitic or unaccented, and as far as possible deprived of distinctive tonal character.

The use of hyphens, though most essential, is yet difficult to regulate by any stringent law, and much must be left to discretion.

# ERRATA.
