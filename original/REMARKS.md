# REMARKS.

There are many matters which it would be interesting and useful, and even indispensable, to set forth in the introduction to a complete Dictionary of this language, but from causes already referred to, most of them cannot even be touched upon here. A few notes, however, are imperatively necessary.

## VOWELS.

a pronounced like *a* in *far*
e pronounced like *e* in *bed*
i pronounced like *i* in *seen*.
o pronounced like *o* in *saw*, but a little more open.
u pronounced like *u* in *put*, *rude*.
ṳ nearly as u in lowland Scotch *abune*; or *eu* in French *heure*.

## DIPHTHONGS.

ai, au, oa, oai, oi, ou, ua, ui. In all these each vowel is pronounced with its own proper sound.

## CONSONANTS.

The consonants are nearly all as in English.

ch is pronounced as in *church*.
g is always hard as in *go*; never as in *gin*.
h is always sounded except when final.
j is pronounced as in *jet*.
ng, as in *sing*, *ring*,
s, always as in *so*, *sing*; never as in *lose*.
z, always as *ds* or *dz*; never as in *zeal*, *zone*.
k and t as finals are so much alike as to be scarcely distinguishable.
m and ng will be founded written any vowel (e.g. n̂g, m̄); often also preceded by a consonant (e.g. hm̄, sńg, kng, kñg). “The nature of these syllables without a distinct vowel becomes at once unmistakable in singing, as at such a word all vocal sound at once ceases, and nothing is heard but a dull nasal murmur

“The ASPIRATED CONSONANTS are a very remakrable feature in all the languages of China, and require very special attention. They are kh, th, ph, and chh. The sounds are the same as those indicated by the same notation in the languages of India, being formed by a real distinct aspiration pronounced after the respective consonants......The sounds are almost the same as those often used by Irish-men when pronouncing with a strong borgue such words as *come*, *pig*, *&c*; they are also often heard in the mouths of the Scottish Highlanders.

“kh may be thus described :— Pronounce....*look here!* repidly and clearly, cut off *loo-* and *-re*, and you have the Chinese ‘khi’.” * The other aspirated consonants might be illustrated in a similar manner.
[ch is *not* an aspirated consonant — see above.]

* From Dr. Carstaire Douglas's admirable Dictionary of the Amoy Vernacular, an invaluable work to the student of the closely allied vernacular of Swatow.

# ERRATA.

On the next page are a few errors, chiefly misprints, which have been observed. It would be too much to hope that many more will not appear afterwards.
